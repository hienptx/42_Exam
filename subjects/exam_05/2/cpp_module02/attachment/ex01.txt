Create a class vect2 representing a mathematical vector of dimension 2 containing elements of int

It must suport addition, subtraction and multiplication by a scalar
(such as the expression (vect2(2,2) * 2) = vect2(4,4) is true)

The operator [] can be used to access the components of your vector (using indices 0 and 1)
no bound checking is required

Your object must be printable with << operator, such that std::cout << v << std::endl produces
the same output as:
std::cout << "{" << v[0] << ", " << v[1] << "}" << std::endl;

you will find a main in this directory that mus work with your class.
